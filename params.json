{"name":"Swing","tagline":"A Python/JavaScript framework for online cognitive science and psychology experiments","body":"### Welcome to Swing\r\nSwing is a Python/JavaScript framework for putting cognitive science and psychology experiments. It can select the trials to be run in an experiment from a .CSV file, shuffle these trials and present them as a single web page, using PsiTurk, the \"open platform for science on Amazon Mechanical Turk\", to deploy the experiment and collect data from online participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Swing can be used in many fields of science; however, it is specifically designed for studies in cognitive science and psychology.\r\n\r\n### About Swing\r\nWritten by: Valeria Staneva, MIT'18, 6-3, (@vstaneva)\r\n\r\nUROP Dept: 9, Computational Cognitive Science Group & TedLab\r\n\r\nFaculty supervisor: Dr J.
